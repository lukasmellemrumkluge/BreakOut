GAME : PongOut

Bricks are stored as a 32x8 array of bits, each bit representing one brick.
The position of the bricks are fixed, according to coordinates below.

Two types of bricks exist: normal and special.
A separate 32x8 array of bits indicate which bricks are special.

These arrays are more specifically arrays of 8 uint32_t.
With bits in the integers being x location, and array position y location.

 -- IMPORTANT:

Coordinates mentioned from here are zero-indexed, and rounded down.
So a ball placement of 32.5 is rounded down to pixel 32.

 -- BOUNDARIES:

The boundaries mentioned here are the boundaries the ball has to cross.
For example, the left paddle's boundary would be its right edge.

Left level bound:   7
Left paddle :       9
Left brick bound:   33
Right brick bound:  96
Right paddle:       119
Right level bound:  121

 -- DIMENSIONS:

Paddle height:  6
Brick width:    2
Brick height:   4
